// ProbableCause - The value of the probable cause may be a specific standardized string, or any vendor provided string. Probable cause strings are not standardized in the present document. They may be added in a future version. Up to then the mapping of the generic probable cause strings \"PROBABLE_CAUSE_001\" to \"PROBABLE_CAUSE_005\" is vendor specific. The value of the probable cause may also be an integer. The mapping of integer values to probable causes is vendor specific.
