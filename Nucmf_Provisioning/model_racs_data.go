// RacsData - Represents a UE radio capability data provided by the NF service consumer.
type RacsData struct {

	// A string used to indicate the features supported by an API that is used as defined in clause  6.6 in 3GPP TS 29.500. The string shall contain a bitmask indicating supported features in  hexadecimal representation Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\",  \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent the support of 4 features as described in  table 5.2.2-3. The most significant character representing the highest-numbered features shall  appear first in the string, and the character representing features 1 to 4 shall appear last  in the string. The list of features and their numbering (starting with 1) are defined  separately for each API. If the string contains a lower number of characters than there are  defined features for an API, all features that would be represented by characters that are not  present in the string are not supported. 
	SuppFeat string `json:"suppFeat,omitempty"`

	// Identifies the configuration related to manufacturer specific UE radio capability. Each element uniquely identifies an RACS configuration for an RACS ID and is identified in the map via the RACS ID as key. The response shall include successfully provisioned RACS data. 
	RacsConfigs map[string]RacsConfiguration `json:"racsConfigs"`

	// Contains the RACS IDs for which the RACS data are not provisioned successfully. The failure reason is also included. Any string value can be used as a key of the map. 
	RacsReports map[string]RacsFailureReport `json:"racsReports,omitempty"`
